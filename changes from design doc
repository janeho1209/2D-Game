Originally planned to have an extra character to widen scope as suggested by grader, along with the quiz segment at the end testing your knowledge, but I made a fatal time-costing mixup
that led me to scrapping both things. To hopefully not let those assets go to waste, I'll put the things I wasn't able to implement in the Google Drive below if they're of interest:

Here's the rest of the script too:

Aika: Allll righty, let’s put your knowledge to the test!!
Aika: First off: What game do I like to play?

Fireboy and Watergirl
Dress to Impress
Dark Souls III

Aika: Who else lives in this house with me?

No one. Absolutely all alone. There is definitely nothing in these walls.
IDK LIKE AN APPALACHIAN CRYPTID I GUESS???
Willy

Aika: Aaand finally, the most difficult of all…What’s my favorite animal?

Cat
Car
Cryolophosaurus

Correct line: Correct!! Nice job!
Incorrect line: Errr, li’l off the mark, there…

Not 3/3: Still some work that needs to be done…b-but no matter! We’ll just keep going ‘til you win!
3/3: Wow, you got it on the first try!! You’ll have a super easy time in this world, let’s give you another one!
You: Hey. Hey, no no no no no, YOU SAID you’d let me go after this! I’m not even getting paid for my labor here…
Aika: Ehe~ Actually, I said I’d let you go once you finish testing, and it’s not quite finished yet~
You: All right, I’m about to start breaking things.
Aika: W-WAIT! C’mon, don’t you wanna see the other cute girls you can choose from!? I’m sure at least one of them will be your type!!
You: Okay? That sounds great and all, but what if I don’t even like girls??
Aika: *siiiiiiigh*.......
Aika: OKAY!! FINE!!!! HAVE IT YOUR WAY SINCE YOU’RE SO DAMN PICKY!!!!
Jason: Heeyyyyy champ!! It’s your smartest, hottest, rizziest best bro in the whole world!
You: …I’m pretty sure plain boiled chicken has more seasoning than this character design.
Jason: Ghhh…! Look man, I wasn’t expecting to get thrown in here all of a sudden!!
Aika: I had no plans for male options to connect with in the first place, so I just threw in the only non-woman character I had, which would be the main character’s best friend. Welcome. Bet you feel flattered I’m putting in all this work for you.
You: I mean, I wasn’t really asking for a male option, I was just finding an excuse to get out of here…
Aika: ALL YOU DO IS COMPLAIN DON’T YOU!? WAHH WAHH WAHHHHH I DON’T WANNA HEAR IT!!!!
You: . Sounds good.
